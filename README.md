# RWave

RWave is going to be a Z-Wave implementation for EventMachine based on
the protocol information found in the OpenZWave project.

This project is obviously in a pretty early stage of development.
APIs may change and the project name may change. If you need to use
Z-Wave from Ruby, please do not hesitate contributing!
